# Forecasting Material Orders for Mercadona

This project contains a forecast of future orders of materials for Mercadona, based on historical data. The project includes exploratory data analysis, clustering of materials into batches, and the creation of corresponding models for each of the materials.

## Data

The data used in this project is contained in an Excel file, which includes quarterly data of past orders for each material. The file is called time_series_df1.xlsx

## The Notebook

The  notebook contains the code used to conduct exploratory data analysis on the historical order data, including visualizations and statistical tests to better understand the data.

Furthermore it performs hierarchical and agglomerative clustering to split the materials into batches which were analyzed individually. 

Finnaly the model selection was performed and the future values were forecasted for each of the materials.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of exploratory data analysis, clustering, and modelling to build a forecast of future orders for Mercadona. The code and data used in this project are included in this repository.
